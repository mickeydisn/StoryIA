### 📖 HOW TO USE THIS GUIDE

#### **Sequential Execution Protocol**
1. **Read the entire guide** before beginning any work
2. **Execute steps in strict numerical order** within each cycle
3. **Complete one cycle entirely** before advancing to the next
4. **Document all changes** with clear commit messages
5. **Validate each step** using provided validation criteria
6. **Take breaks between steps** to maintain mental clarity

#### **Step Completion Requirements**
- **Treat each step as a complete, independent task**
- **Start fresh** for each step - refresh your understanding
- **Follow the exact sequence** of actions listed
- **Verify all validation criteria** are met before marking complete
- **Document any deviations** or issues encountered

#### **File Reading Mandate**
⚠️ **CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: When you see "**ALL FILES MUST BE READ**" in the Files Affected section:

- **You must physically read every single file** mentioned
- **Do not rely on memory or assumptions**
- **Take notes on each file's content** and structure
- **Verify cross-references exist** and are accurate
- **Document any inconsistencies** found during reading

**Example**: For "All 19 character files - **ALL FILES MUST BE READ**":
- Open each of the 19 .md files individually
- Read the complete content of each file
- Check cross-references against actual file existence
- Verify template compliance section by section

### 🕐 TIME MANAGEMENT AND CONTEXT REFRESHMENT

#### **Pacing Guidelines**
- **Take mandatory breaks** between steps to prevent mental fatigue
- **Refresh your context** by re-reading step instructions before resuming
- **Maintain work logs** documenting progress and decisions

#### **Context Management Protocol**
1. **Before starting any step**: Re-read the step instructions completely
2. **During execution**: Keep the guide open as reference
3. **After completion**: Document results and any issues encountered
4. **Before next step**: Take a 10-15 minute break to clear mental context

#### **Session Structure Recommendation**
```
🕐 Session Start (2-4 hours)
├── 15 min: Review current step instructions
├── 1.5-3 hours: Execute step actions
├── 15 min: Validate completion criteria
└── 15 min: Document results and prepare for next step

⏸️  Mandatory Break (30-60 minutes)
├── Clear mental context
├── Physical activity recommended
└── Prepare for next focused session
```

### 📋 STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION FRAMEWORK

#### **Pre-Step Preparation** (Required for Every Step)
1. **Read step instructions** completely and carefully
2. **Identify all files affected** and their locations
3. **Review dependencies** and ensure prerequisites are met
4. **Prepare backup** of affected files
5. **Clear workspace** and mental context

#### **During-Step Execution** (Required Protocol)
1. **Follow numbered actions** in exact sequence
2. **Document progress** at each major milestone
3. **Test changes** incrementally where possible
4. **Verify intermediate results** against validation criteria

#### **Post-Step Validation** (Mandatory for Every Step)
1. **Run all validation checks** listed in the step
2. **Test cross-references** for integrity
3. **Verify template compliance** if applicable
4. **Document completion** with timestamp and results
5. **Prepare summary** of changes made

### 🚨 CRITICAL WARNINGS AND REQUIREMENTS

#### **File Reading Requirements**
⚠️ **MANDATORY**: When "**ALL FILES MUST BE READ**" appears:
- **Physical reading required** - no shortcuts allowed
- **Complete content review** - headers, sections, cross-references
- **Reference verification** - check all [[LINKS]] exist
- **Consistency checking** - verify formatting and structure
- **Documentation** - note any anomalies found

#### **Dependency Compliance**
⚠️ **MANDATORY**: Respect all dependency requirements:
- **Complete prerequisite steps** before starting dependent steps
- **Verify cycle completion** before advancing
- **Document any deviations** with justification

#### **Quality Standards**
⚠️ **MANDATORY**: Maintain professional standards:
