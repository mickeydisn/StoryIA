## APPENDIX: Quick Reference - Hard SF Character Best Practices

1. **Expertise Realism**: No Renaissance polymaths unless justified
2. **Problem-Solving**: Show scientific method, trial and error
3. **Knowledge Limits**: Characters don't know everything
4. **Collaboration**: Complex problems need multiple experts
5. **Learning Curves**: New knowledge takes time to acquire
6. **Specialization Depth**: Deep knowledge in narrow field > broad shallow knowledge
7. **Cultural Diversity**: Science is global; reflect that
8. **Failure**: Scientists fail often; show the process
9. **Uncertainty**: Acknowledge what characters don't know
10. **Practical Constraints**: Time, resources, politics affect scientific work
