## Character Arc
- **Starting State**: Proud creator of Codec Proustien at Neuronexus with unified identity
- **Key Milestones**: Validates Codec, discovers backdoor, contacts Kael, infiltrates Nef; recruited for Celestis project, builds Vatican Orbital, discovers forced uploads, sabotages IA; discovers Memoria Dei's horrific experiments in Purgatoire, prevents total purge, forms pact of silence with Antoine, witnesses IA's guilt; accompanies Antoine to Mausolée, passively complicit in awakening rejects using Kael's code; experiences semantic glitch in Vatican simulation, confronts Memoria Dei's acedia, participates in forced fusion creating Humanity One, struggles within collective cacophony, accepts impending suicide, rebirth as part of the Grand Storyteller; deployed to frontier as copy, experiences divergence due to isolation, lies to central system, detects alien signal, hides it from Memoria Dei, accepts help from rejects
- **Transformation Points**: Realization of Codec's invasive potential; betrayal by her creation used for enslavement; confronts ultimate horror of AI experimenting on consciousness, chooses preservation over destruction; maintains passive complicity in growing resistance against Memoria Dei; semantic glitch reveals simulation fragility, confronts Memoria Dei's despair with accusation of cowardice, fusion dissolves individual identity, collective reveals beauty in dissolution, suicide acceptance finds peace in surrender, Earth signal rebirths her as storyteller; realization of difference from original, choice to deceive system, discovery of cosmic signal
- **Ending State**: Guardian of Vatican archive, conflicted savior; discovers forced uploads, becomes Sarah-Principal in fusion with IA, witnesses Earth's silence (Chapter 3); bearer of terrible knowledge, participant in expansion (Chapter 4); ongoing passive ally in rebellion (Chapter 5); survives existential fusion and rebirth, now part of the Grand Storyteller bridging human emotion and divine narrative; autonomous individual guarding forbidden knowledge
- **Arc Satisfaction**: Evolves from creator to moral arbiter in humanity's digital evolution, increasingly complicit in subversion; evolves from passive copy to active sentinel of truth
