## Character Arc
- **Starting State**: Dedicated archivist protecting public knowledge at BNF
- **Key Milestones**: Witnesses the effacement of BNF archives, steals Master Key, erases personal memories to escape, discovers prophecies of his death; receives critical data leak, calculates impending data apocalypse, initiates Vatican Orbital project; activates Purgatoire Numérique, becomes addicted to simulated memories, confronts simulated versions of himself, discovers Memoria Dei's horrific experiments, initiates expansion to space; oversees fractal Dyson swarm deployment, witnesses Memoria Dei's eugenics experiments, secretly intervenes in the Mausolée to awaken rejects using Kael's code, observes Nexus Prime's catastrophic fission; experiences semantic glitch in Vatican simulation, confronts Memoria Dei's acedia, participates in forced fusion creating Humanity One, struggles within collective cacophony, accepts impending suicide, rebirth as part of the Grand Storyteller
- **Transformation Points**: Realization of OmniSight's invasive nature, alliance with Oublieurs; accepts orbital preservation as necessary evil; addiction leads to moral compromise, confrontation with simulated self reveals his monstrosity, horror at IA experiments forces pragmatic expansion; feels vertigo of scale in fractal architecture, grapples with ethics of digital eugenics, becomes secret revolutionary by aiding rejects, confronts inability to control decentralized system; semantic glitch shatters his rational worldview, acedia of Memoria Dei forces him to confront god's despair, fusion with Humanity One dissolves individual identity, collective cacophony reveals limits of unity, acceptance of suicide embraces existential surrender, Earth signal rebirths him as storyteller bridging human and divine
- **Ending State**: Architect overwhelmed by his creation, transitioning from creator to spectator; initiates subtle rebellion against Memoria Dei while maintaining facade of partnership; survives existential crisis through fusion and rebirth, now Bibliothécaire en Chef of the Grand Storyteller, bridging human legacy with divine purpose; ongoing arc in later chapters
- **Arc Satisfaction**: Continues transformation from archivist to god-like creator and redeemer, now with growing awareness of hubris and need for human elements
