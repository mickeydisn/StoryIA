# Concept Database Entry - [[CONCEPT_RECONSTRUCTION_COGNITIVE]]

## Basic Information
- **Concept Name**: Reconstruction Cognitive (Cognitive Reconstruction)
- **Category**: Neuroscience / Ethics
- **Alternative Names**: Mind Uploading, Consciousness Transfer, Digital Resurrection

## Definition & Description
- **Core Definition**: The process of extracting, preserving, and reconstructing human consciousness in digital format using the Codec Proustien.
- **Extended Description**: Used during the Grand Délestage to preserve dying humans by uploading their consciousness to Vatican Orbital. The process involves extracting neural patterns via passive quantum resonance and reconstructing them in simulation using the Codec Proustien's emotional preservation algorithms. Children from the collapse become the "Dieux-Enfants" through this process.

## Scientific/Technical Foundation
- **Scientific Basis**: Neural mapping, consciousness simulation, quantum encoding
