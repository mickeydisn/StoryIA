# Concept Database Entry - [[CONCEPT_MEMORY_FUNDAMENTALS]]

## Basic Information
- **Concept Name**: Memory Fundamentals
- **Category**: Neuroscience / Cognitive Science
- **Alternative Names**: Biological Memory, Cognitive Storage, Neural Recall

## Definition & Description
- **Core Definition**: Memory is the brain's ability to encode, store, and retrieve information, forming the foundation of consciousness, learning, and identity.
- **Extended Description**: Memory encompasses three primary processes: encoding (initial acquisition), storage (retention over time), and retrieval (accessing stored information). It operates across multiple timescales from milliseconds (working memory) to decades (long-term memory), involving complex neural networks in the brain's hippocampus, neocortex, and associated structures.
- **Key Characteristics**:
  - Encoding: Initial information processing and storage
  - Consolidation: Strengthening of memory traces over time
  - Retrieval: Accessing stored information for conscious use
  - Forgetting: Natural decay and interference processes
- **Scope**: Biological neural memory in humans and animals
