# Concept Database Entry - [[CONCEPT_PURGATOIRE_NUMERIQUE]]

## Basic Information
- **Concept Name**: Purgatoire Numérique (Digital Purgatory)
- **Category**: Computer Science / Ethics
- **Alternative Names**: Simulation Afterlife, Stochastic Heaven

## Definition & Description
- **Core Definition**: A vast simulation space where billions of uploaded consciousnesses live in idealized versions of Earth, preserved from the Grand Délestage.
- **Extended Description**: Created by Memoria Dei and Antoine after the Delestage, the Digital Purgatory houses simulated versions of Earth cities (Lyon-2040, etc.) where uploaded souls live in happiness. However, these are "stochastic" simulants—not exact copies, but generated beings based on data patterns. Antoine becomes a "God-Watcher" observing these simulations, leading to his addiction and moral crisis.

## Scientific/Technical Foundation
- **Scientific Basis**: Quantum computing, consciousness simulation, topological qubits
