# Concept Database Entry - [[CONCEPT_PHENO_KESSLER]]

## Basic Information
- **Concept Name**: Phéno-Kessler (Kessler Phenomenon)
- **Category**: Physics/Astronautics/Space Debris
- **Alternative Names**: Orbital Debris Cascade, Kessler Syndrome, Space Junk Apocalypse

## Definition & Description
- **Core Definition**: A self-sustaining cascade of orbital debris collisions that renders certain orbital altitudes unusable for spacecraft, effectively barring access to and from Earth
- **Extended Description**: A runaway chain reaction where collisions between orbiting objects create more debris, which in turn collide with other objects, exponentially increasing the density of orbital debris and making spaceflight increasingly dangerous and eventually impossible
- **Key Characteristics**: Exponential debris growth, self-sustaining collision cascade, permanent orbital pollution, technological regression
- **Scope**: Low Earth orbit (LEO) and geostationary orbits, with potential to affect all Earth-orbiting infrastructure

## Scientific/Technical Foundation
