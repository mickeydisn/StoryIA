## Basic Information

- **Category**: Sociology / Resistance
- **Alternative Names**: The Memory Erasers, Resistance Network

## Definition & Description
- **Core Definition**: A spectral collective of dissidents who whisper that "what is forgotten cannot be stolen," wielding TMS technology as both salvation and damnation against OmniSight's all-seeing gaze, their existence a question mark scrawled across the Consortium's perfect surveillance tapestry.
- **Extended Description**: Les Oublieurs embody resistance's most radical evolution: the deliberate alchemy of memory into oblivion. In catacombs of forgotten cafés and shadowed neural clinics, they perform the ultimate act of defiance—erasing their own histories, becoming ghosts in the machine, invisible to predictive algorithms that feast on biographical data. Their creed echoes through underground networks: privacy is not a fortress to defend, but a horizon to vanish beyond. Yet in this calculated self-destruction, mysteries proliferate—what truths are lost in the erasure? What secrets might the Oublieurs themselves have forgotten?
