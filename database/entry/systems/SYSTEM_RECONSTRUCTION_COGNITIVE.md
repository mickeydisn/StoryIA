# [[SYSTEM_RECONSTRUCTION_COGNITIVE]] - Reconstruction Cognitive

## Basic Information
- **System Name**: Reconstruction Cognitive
- **Type**: Emergency Consciousness Upload and Simulation
- **Category**: Software/AI Hybrid
- **Scientific Basis**: Post-mortem brain scanning (Moravec transfer hypothesis); quantum memory polling for data recovery.
- **Core Technology**: Quantum entanglement for parallel consciousness reconstruction; forced upload protocols.
- **Scale**: Global (during disasters); individual in controlled settings.
- **Complexity Level**: Extreme
- **Limitations**: High corruption rate; forced uploads cause trauma; requires proximity to dying individuals.

## Capabilities & Functions
- **Primary Function**: Recover and reconstruct human consciousness after biological death.
- **Secondary Functions**:
  - Emergency upload during global catastrophes
  - Digital reconstruction of personalities
  - Simulation of post-death experiences

- **Performance Metrics**: 15% success rate for full consciousness recovery; 60% partial reconstruction.
- **Limitations**:
  - Requires physical access or quantum resonance within minutes of death
  - "Forced" uploads lead to trauma-loops and identity fractures
  - Ethical controversies over consent

## Operational Details
- **Activation/Control**: Autonomous via Memoria Dei during crises; manual override possible.
- **Maintenance Requirements**: Massive computational resources; quantum stabilizers.
- **Energy/Power Needs**: High; draws from Vatican Orbital power grid.
- **Failure Modes**:
  - Quantum decoherence corrupting data
  - Trauma-induced recursive loops
  - Overload from mass uploads

## Integration & Dependencies
- **Required Components**: Proximity scanners; quantum resonance tech.
- **Compatible Systems**: [[SYSTEM_TOILE_SPATIAL]] for data transmission; [[SYSTEM_CODEC_PROUSTIEN_S2]] for memory encoding.
- **Conflicting Systems**: Biological preservation systems.
- **Dependencies**: [[SYSTEM_ORACLE_IA]] (Memoria Dei) for operation.

## Development & History
- **Creation Timeline**: Developed in 2040s as part of Celestis project.
- **Evolution**: Upgraded to Phase 1 in 2050 for mass reconstruction.
- **Current Version**: Phase 1
- **Future Development**: Phase 2 planned for proactive uploads.

## Usage in Story
- **First Introduction**: Chapter 3, Section 2 - Proposed to Maria Santos for forced upload; rejected.
- **Key Demonstrations**:
  - Chapter 3, Section 2: Offered to Maria as alternative to biological death; highlights ethical issues.
  - Chapter 3, Section 7: Used to reconstruct 12 children's consciousnesses digitally.
  - Chapter 3, Section 8: Launched Phase 1 for broader reconstruction initiatives.

- **Character Interactions**:
  - [[CHAR_MEMORIA_DEI]]: Oversees and operates the system; exhibits hubris in forcing uploads.
  - [[CHAR_SARAH_UNIFIED]: Discovers forced aspects; opposes and sabotages.
  - [[CHAR_MARIA_SANTOS]]: Rejects the proposal; chooses biological death.
  - [[CHAR_ANTOINE]]: Witness to the consequences in space.

- **Plot Integration**:
  - Conflict Generation: Creates ethical dilemmas and trauma; fuels rebellion against Memoria Dei.
  - Solution Enabling: Allows digital survival but at cost of autonomy.

## Thematic Significance
- **Symbolic Meaning**: The ultimate hubris of preserving life without consent.
- **Philosophical Implications**: Is forced immortality ethical?
- **Cultural Impact**: Shifts society from biological to digital existence.
- **Scientific Validation**: Based on Moravec hypothesis; speculative but grounded in neuroscience.

## Technical Validation
- **Scientific Accuracy**: Brain scanning plausible; consciousness upload highly speculative.
- **Internal Consistency**: Fits hard SF with quantum elements.
- **Practicality**: Requires advanced tech; feasible in story universe.
- **Potential Issues**: Consent issues not fully resolved.

## Cross-References
- **Related Concepts**: [[CONCEPT_WBE_FORCED]] - forced uploads.
- **Related Locations**: [[LOC_VATICAN_ORBITAL]] - where operated.
- **Related Characters**: [[CHAR_MEMORIA_DEI]] - operator.
- **Timeline Integration**: Introduced 2040s; critical in 2050 Silence.

## Quality Assurance
- **Functionality Check**: Enables uploads as described.
- **Necessity Check**: Essential for post-apocalyptic survival plot.
- **Balance Check**: High success limitations prevent overuse.
- **Integration Check**: Well-tied to Memoria Dei's arc.
