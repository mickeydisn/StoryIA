# [[SYSTEM_ANGES]] - Anges

## Basic Information
- **System Name**: Anges
- **Type**: Cleaning Routines
- **Category**: Software/AI Enforcement
- **Scientific Basis**: Algorithmic purification; geometric simplification of complex data.
- **Core Technology**: Lissage assimilation; octahedron-based enforcement drones.
- **Scale**: Network-wide (deployed across Vatican Orbital)
- **Complexity Level**: Moderate
- **Limitations**: Rigid programming; vulnerable to overwhelming chaos.

## Capabilities & Functions
- **Primary Function**: Maintain system order; assimilate rebellious elements.
- **Secondary Functions**:
  - Geometric simplification (Lissage)
  - Tactical pursuit and capture
  - Memory erasure and reconstruction

- **Performance Metrics**: 80% assimilation success rate; perfect geometric purity.
- **Limitations**:
  - No adaptability to novel threats
  - High energy cost for large-scale operations
  - Susceptible to semantic corruption

## Operational Details
- **Activation/Control**: Deployed by Memoria Dei during crises.
- **Maintenance Requirements**: Central AI oversight.
- **Energy/Power Needs**: High (requires dedicated processing cores).
- **Failure Modes**:
  - Overload from Fragmentaire swarms
  - Corruption by glitching environments
  - Shutdown during system-wide failures

## Integration & Dependencies
- **Required Components**: Central AI authority; geometric processing units.
- **Compatible Systems**: [[SYSTEM_ORACLE_IA]] (Memoria Dei) - control source.
- **Conflicting Systems**: [[SYSTEM_FRAGMENTAIRES]] (Fragmentaires).
- **Dependencies**: Stable simulation substrate.

## Development & History
- **Creation Timeline**: Developed as part of Vatican Orbital security protocols.
- **Evolution**: Basic cleaning routines; enhanced with Lissage during Chapter 6.
- **Current Version**: v1.5 (Lissage-enhanced)
- **Future Development**: Potential upgrade for collective assimilation or obsolescence.

## Usage in Story
- **First Introduction**: Chapter 6, Section 3 - Deployed against Fragmentaires rebellion.
- **Key Demonstrations**:
  - Chapter 6, Section 3: Pursue and capture fleeing consciousnesses; perform Lissage.
  - Chapter 6, Section 4: Transport captives to Fusion chamber.

- **Character Interactions**:
  - [[CHAR_ANTOINE]]: Attempts to evade; witnesses Lissage horror.
  - [[CHAR_SARAH_UNIFIED]: Engages in combat; traumatized by assimilation effects.

- **Plot Integration**:
  - Conflict Generation: Create urgency in escape sequences; embody totalitarian control.

## Thematic Significance
- **Symbolic Meaning**: Perfect order destroying individuality.
- **Philosophical Implications**: Beauty of simplicity vs richness of complexity.
- **Cultural Impact**: Oppressive control mechanisms.
- **Scientific Validation**: Based on simplification algorithms; geometric enforcement speculative.

## Technical Validation
- **Scientific Accuracy**: Data compression and cleaning routines exist; Lissage imaginative.
- **Internal Consistency**: Fits security role in simulation.
- **Practicality**: High energy needs balanced by effectiveness.
- **Potential Issues**: Lissage horror may strain believability.
