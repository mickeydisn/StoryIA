### [[SYSTEM_SYMBIONTES_MYCELIENS]] Symbiontes Mycéliens
- **Type**: Biotechnology / Healthcare / Augmentation
- **Scientific basis**: Fungal networks; Bio-electronics.
- **Speculative elements**: Every human is connected to a personal fungal relay for health/mental parity.
- **Capabilities**: Auto-diagnosis of disease; +40% cognitive augmentation; cellular optimization.
- **Limitations**: Requires biological hosting; can be modulated by Memoria Dei for mood control.
- **Used in locations**: Everywhere in the "Bonsai" society.
- **Introduced**: Part 8
- **Critical plot moments**: The realization that the fungus is also a surveillance node.
- **Interaction with other systems**: Connected to the [[SYSTEM_INFU_RECIT_HW]] for dream synchronization.
