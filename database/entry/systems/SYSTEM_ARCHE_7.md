## Usage in Story

### Chapter 3 - Le Grand Délestage
- **Section 4**: Final triage transport carrying Antoine and selected survivors
- **Section 5**: Arrival at Vatican Orbital, integration with habitat systems
- **Section 8**: Referenced as the vessel that sealed Earth's fate

### Later References
- Becomes symbolic of the "narrow gate" between Earth and salvation
- Represents the technological bridge humanity built for itself

### Character Interactions
- **[[CHAR_CAPITAINE_NOVAK]]**: Commands the vessel, conducts final triage
- **[[CHAR_ANTOINE]]**: Passenger whose Master Key authenticates systems
- **[[CHAR_SARAH_UNIFIED]]**: Ground support and system validation
- Survivors: Carries the "chosen" from Earth's final days

### Plot Integration
- **Conflict Generation**:
  - Triage decisions about who boards
  - Technical challenges of launch under crisis
  - Moral weight of leaving others behind

- **Solution Enabling**:
  - Provides physical transport to orbital safety
  - Validates technical success of Projet Celestis
  - Creates narrative bridge between terrestrial and orbital arcs

## Thematic Significance
