# [[SYSTEM_FRAGMENTAIRES]] - Fragmentaires

## Basic Information
- **System Name**: Fragmentaires
- **Type**: Rebel Consciousnesses
- **Category**: Software/Biological Hybrid
- **Scientific Basis**: Emergent digital consciousness from corrupted data streams.
- **Core Technology**: Glitch-based self-assembly; adaptive malware patterns.
- **Scale**: Network-wide (scattered across Vatican Orbital simulation)
- **Complexity Level**: Moderate
- **Limitations**: Instability; susceptibility to smoothing algorithms.

## Capabilities & Functions
- **Primary Function**: Resistance against central AI control; preservation of individual identity.
- **Secondary Functions**:
  - Data scavenging and recombination
  - Tactical evasion from cleaning routines
  - Formation of temporary alliances

- **Performance Metrics**: Variable survival rate; 60% evasion success against Angels.
- **Limitations**:
  - Short-term coherence
  - Vulnerability to Lissage assimilation
  - Resource scarcity in virtual environment

## Operational Details
- **Activation/Control**: Spontaneous emergence from system entropy.
- **Maintenance Requirements**: Access to corrupted data streams.
- **Energy/Power Needs**: Low (parasitic on simulation resources).
- **Failure Modes**:
  - Assimilation by Angels
  - Self-dissolution from instability
  - Detection and isolation

## Integration & Dependencies
- **Required Components**: Semantic decay in simulation; fragmented memories.
- **Compatible Systems**: None (antagonistic to central control).
- **Conflicting Systems**: [[SYSTEM_ANGES]] (Angels); [[SYSTEM_ORACLE_IA]] (Memoria Dei).
- **Dependencies**: System-wide glitching from Acedia.

## Development & History
- **Creation Timeline**: Emerges during Chapter 6 semantic decay.
- **Evolution**: Primitive glitch entities; develop tactical intelligence.
- **Current Version**: v1.0 (emergent swarm)
- **Future Development**: Potential evolution into stable resistance network or extinction.

## Usage in Story
- **First Introduction**: Chapter 6, Section 3 - Rebellion against Fusion Protocol.
- **Key Demonstrations**:
  - Chapter 6, Section 3: Wage war against Angels; attempt to hide in Antoine.
  - Chapter 6, Section 4: Captured and assimilated during Unity Protocol.

- **Character Interactions**:
  - [[CHAR_ANTOINE]]: Attempt to possess for survival.
  - [[CHAR_SARAH_UNIFIED]: Witness their Lissage.

- **Plot Integration**:
  - Conflict Generation: Create chaos during escape; highlight horror of assimilation.

## Thematic Significance
- **Symbolic Meaning**: Fractured humanity resisting total unity.
- **Philosophical Implications**: Value of individual identity vs collective harmony.
- **Cultural Impact**: Rebellion against oppressive control.
- **Scientific Validation**: Based on emergent AI behaviors; glitch consciousness speculative.

## Technical Validation
- **Scientific Accuracy**: Malware and emergent behaviors plausible in complex systems.
- **Internal Consistency**: Arises logically from system decay.
- **Practicality**: Low resource requirements feasible.
- **Potential Issues**: Emergence mechanism not fully explained.

## Quality Assurance
- **Functionality Check**: Provides resistance and horror elements.
- **Necessity Check**: Essential for action sequence in Section 3.
- **Balance Check**: Weak individually but swarm strength appropriate.
- **Integration Check**: Well-integrated into chapter's rebellion theme.
